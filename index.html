     ‘Spiral Island II’ feels like an island and certainly looks like one with its beaches, mangroves, palm trees, two ponds and a waterfall. But unlike most tropical islands, underneath it there are thousands of plastic bottles to keep it afloat.

    All of this is the work of one man, Rishi (Richart) Sowa, artist, musician, carpenter and idealist. In 1998, Rishi gave up his job and left the UK to live a much simpler life in Mexico. He did not have enough money to buy land so, because he is a practical person, he decided to build his own island which he called ‘Spiral Island’. He collected 250,000 empty plastic bottles, put them into nets and built a wooden structure on top of them. On it, he built a small house and collected soil to plant trees and bushes in.

   <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
    Rishi lived happily on the island with his dog, Rainbow, cats, Bonita and Easy, two chickens and a duck until 2005 when Hurricane Emily washed his island onto the beach and destroyed his home. However, Rishi did not give up and immediately started another island in a slightly more protected part of the coast.

    Spiral Island II is a bit smaller than the first island but is even more comfortable and Rishi’s two-storey house has wind and solar power. It also has a compost toilet, a solar-powered oven, a wave-powered washing machine and a solar-powered waterfall plus a fountain. Rishi’s island is almost self-sufficient; he keeps chickens and so always has a supply of fresh eggs and he grows coconuts, lemons, bananas, tomatoes and almonds.

    Rishi’s island is near the tourist resort of Cancún and the local people have been very understanding and helpful. Visitors help to finance his project and he has a website where he shares his ideas about the future. According to Rishi, his islands help to solve the problem of plastic rubbish which pollutes the sea and kills sea creatures. At the same time, his islands can deal with the problems of rising sea levels and over-population: ‘Maybe building islands is the answer,’ says Rishi. ‘You can be totally self-sufficient on a spiral island. You can catch rainwater for showers and grow your own produce.’ Rishi is optimistic about the future: ‘One day we’ll sail out on the ocean and become a small, floating country,’ he says.
